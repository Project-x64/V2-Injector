# how to use ?
- run v2 injector ( wait around 15-20 seconds if black screen shows this is due to the software trying to find vulnrable modules to inject to on your pc )
- make sure your dll is in the same folder as injector
- run injector before opening game ( if you face vuln error disable antivirus and firewall )
- rename your dll to rwx1.dll
- launch your game ( must be on the same drive as injector )
- input the window class name of the process you are wanting to inject into 
- rwx will exploit the games imports and then proceed  to inject into the games window hook

# supports all windows versions

# little insight on the release
i thought not many people release working injectors these days that can actually inject past EAC and other anti-cheats i want to be able to provide a working injector for upcoming cheat developers or just individual people who dont understand code and want to cheat on a anti-cheat protected game.

## why not release injector source and driver source?
because i dont agree with the fact of many people skidding on developers work in this category ( fair enough for cheats ) but injectors and drivers are more important to keep private although i will sell this source code for a reasonable price.


# extra features
- rwx injection methods 
- emulate anticheats ( eac + be ) - must be windows version 1909 - 20h2 )
- dump anti-cheat drivers 
- dump game offsets + signatures ( Engines supported Ue4, Ue5 , Unity )

## how to find my games window class ?
- if you have visual studio downloaded make sure you have c++ installed
- open any blank project in visual studio
- head over to tools tab and look for spy++
- once spy++ is open use the find window tool in the app
- simply drag the spytool over your game window ( it has to be in windowed mode to find the window class )


## find window class method 2
- head over to https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/winlister.html and download winlister x64 or x32
- open it up look for your process for my example i will use notepad
- right click on the process that you are wanting to inject into
